                   README for SMOG2

SMOG2 is a downloadable software package for generating
structure-based models, as provided by the 
smog-server.org webserver. These models may be used to
perform simulations using Gromacs, or NAMD.

This distribution of SMOG2 includes two versions of 
SMOG models, the C-alpha model (Clementi et al JMB 2000)
and the all-atom model (Whitford et al. Proteins 2009).
The software is written such that you may also design
your own form of structure-based models without having
to modify the source code.

We encourage everyone to provide feedback/suggestions
on usage, extensions and bugs to info@smog-server.org.

      Jeffrey Noel, Jose Onuchic and Paul Whitford

		  CONFIGURING SMOG2

Before using SMOG2, you need to configure your settings.
This is a relatively simple  process.

1) SMOG2 is written in Perl, and requires the following 
modules to be installed (available through cpan):

String::Util
XML::Simple
Data::Dumper
Exporter
perl PDL

2) Once the modules are installed, you need to run the
configure script.  First, modify configure.smog2.  
Specifically, supply values to the following two variables:

smog2dir=""
perl4smog=""

smog2dir is the main smog2 directory (this will have 
src and share as subdirectories), and perl4smog is the
version of perl that you prefer to use.  On linux, the
most common value would be "/usr/bin/perl".  

To finish the configure process, issue the command:
 
source configure.smog2

If you used smog2 frequently, it is recommended that 
you add this line to your .bashrc file, so that you will
not need to re-run config.bash every time you use smog2.
If you do add it to your bashrc, make sure to include
the full path for configure.smog2.

			USAGE

If your configuration step completes successfully, 
running smog2 can be quite simple.  

Note: configure.smog2 defines the alias smog2

For the C-alpha model:
smog2 -i <PDBFILE> -tCG $SMOG_PATH/SBM_calpha -contactRes $SMOG_PATH/SBM_AA 

where <PDBFILE> is the the system for which you would 
like to generate a SMOG model.

To run the All-atom model: 
smog2 -i <PDBFILE> -tAA $SMOG_PATH/SBM_CA  

For a list of all supported flags and options, type:
smog2 --help

For more advanced usage of SMOG2, please consult the
SMOG2 manual.
