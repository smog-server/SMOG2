                  README for SMOG 2.0

SMOG v2 is a downloadable software package for 
generating structure-based models, as provided by the 
smog-server.org webserver (i.e. SMOG v1). These models 
may be used to perform simulations using Gromacs, 
or NAMD.

SMOG2 is free software, distributed under the GNU 
General Public License. See COPYING.

This distribution of SMOG v2 includes two versions of 
SMOG models, the C-alpha model (Clementi et al JMB 2000)
and the all-atom model (Whitford et al. Proteins 2009).
The software is written such that you may also design
your own form of structure-based models without having
to modify the source code.

This README provides the absolute basics for using
SMOG v2.  For more advanced usage information, consult
the manual, available at smog-server.org

We encourage everyone to provide feedback/suggestions
on usage, extensions and bugs to info@smog-server.org.

		  CONFIGURING SMOG v2

Before using SMOG v2, you need to configure your settings.
This is a relatively simple  process.

1) SMOG v2 is written in Perl, and requires the 
following  modules to be installed (available through 
cpan):

String::Util
XML::Simple
Exporter
perl PDL

1a) If you do not have java installed (uncommon), then
you will have to install it.

2) Once the modules and java are installed, you need to 
run the configure script. First, modify configure.smog2  
Specifically, give values to the following two 
variables:

smog2dir=""
perl4smog=""

smog2dir is the main SMOG v2 directory (this will have 
src and share as subdirectories), and perl4smog is the
version of perl that you prefer to use.  On linux, the
most common value for perl4smog is "/usr/bin/perl".  

To finish the configure process, issue the command:
 
source configure.smog2

If configuration is complete, you will have a directory
$smog2dir/bin, which will contain wrappers for SMOG 2,
as well as for tools described in the manual. If you
call the configure script multiple times, new files
will not be created, but the environment will still
be initialized.

If you use SMOG frequently, it is recommended that 
you add the configure line to your .bashrc file, so 
you will not need to re-run configure.smog2 every time 
you use SMOG. If you do add it to your bashrc, make 
sure to include the full path for configure.smog2.

3) (Optional) It is highly recommended that once SMOG
is configured, you download and run the smog-check suite.
This will verify your configurations are correct and that
SMOG is producing accurate forcefield files.

			USAGE

If your configuration step completes successfully, 
running SMOG v2 can be quite simple.  

Note: It is assumed that $SMOG_PATH is properly defined.

To use the default C-alpha model (proteins only) 

smog2 -i <PDBFILE> -CA  

For the default All-atom model: 

smog2 -i <PDBFILE> -AA


If you would like to use other models:

Coarse-grained models
smog2 -i <PDBFILE> -t <CG_TEMPLATES> \
 	-CG -t_contacts $SMOG_PATH/SBM_AA

This example, CG_TEMPLATES is the directory containing 
the CG templates, <PDBFILE> is the the system for which 
you would like to generate a SMOG model.

To run an All-atom model: 
smog2 -i <PDBFILE> -t $SMOG_PATH/SBM_AA  

For a list of all supported flags and options, type:
smog2 --help

For more advanced usage of SMOG v2, please consult the
manual available with the distribution.
