This all-heavy-atom potential is defined in the spirit of Tirion (Tirion et
al.1996 PRL), where the interactions are all harmonic springs and are of
identical strengths. The contact map defaults to a 6 A cutoff between heavy atom
centers (Note: the Tirion contact map uses a variable cutoff to define contacts
of Rvdw(a)+Rvdw(b)+Rc which is not available in smog2, but a user generated map
can be used with option -c). The spring constants between non-bonded atoms are
uniformly unity and can be changed in ENM.nb. There are no angle or dihedral
potentials, the covalent geometry is maintained by harmonic springs of strength
10, which can be changed in ENM.b. The resulting potential does not correspond
exactly to any particular published study, but serves as a example starting
point.
