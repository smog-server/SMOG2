This potential is identical to SBM_AA, but with electric charges added to acidic
and basic residues, phosphates in RNA, and bound magnesium (when named BMG). A
full -1 charge is placed on the acidic or basic group in the PDB. Histidine is
uncharged. Because of the lack of an explicit solvent, it is intended that this
potential is used in conjunction with a Debye-Hueckel non-bonded charge
interaction shape. A script to generate a Gromacs tabulated potential
(smog_tablegen) can be found in the tools directory of the smog2
distribution.

As suggested for Calpha models by Azia A, (2009) JMB, native
contacts with charge-charge interactions have unchanged native contact
potentials. Note that these native charge-charge interactions can perturb the
basic assumption of lack of energetic frustration in the SBM. To avoid this
complication, the cited ribosome study (.citation file) the charge-charge 
interactions are only considered between molecules, not within molecules.
